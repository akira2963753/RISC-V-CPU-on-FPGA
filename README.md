# RISC-V-CPU
**This project is based on [Computer Organization Course](https://github.com/akira2963753/5-Stage-Pipelined-MIPS-CPU) and [UC Berkeley CS 61C Summer 2025](https://cs61c.org/fa25/)**  
  
**I try to design a 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V CPU that supports the RV32I and RV32M, including Forwarding, Hazard Detection, Flush Detection, Dynamic Branch Prediction, and two L1 Caches. Finally, I Implemented on FPGA.**
