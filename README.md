# RISC-V-CPU
In the Spring of 2025, during my **Computer Organization course**,   
I learned how to implement a simple [**5-Stage Pipeline CPU Based on MIPS.**](https://github.com/akira2963753/MIPS-5-stage-pipelined-CPU)    
  
Unfortunately, due to the course schedule, we were unable to implement more advanced features such as **caches** and **branch prediction.** Therefore, to further explore mainstream CPU architecture design, I chose RISC-V as a practice platform. Currently, I have completed the basic five-stage pipeline and can support all **RV32I Base Instructions**, although cache and branch prediction have not yet been implemented.
